### Versions
Unity Version 2019.2.6f1

Oculus Version 1.43

## About This Game
This game is a simulation of the Milky Way solar system. Our goal was to create a simulation that focused on the sheer size of the solar system and the time that it would take to travel the distances between planets. While limiting the player to realistic speed would not be an enjoyable experience, we attempted to emphasize the experience of time and distance by keeping a realistic distance, allowing the speed to be extremely unrealistic, and using time to warp the user's experience. The user starts at the sun and is able to pilot their spaceship between Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto.


## Game Controls
### Right Controller: 

Thumbstick Up: Accelerate Ship 

Thumbstick Down: Decelerate Ship 

Press A: Reset speed to 1 m/s

Press B: Revert to Original Speed

Point index finger to activate/deactivate objects on mini map

### Left Controller: 
Thumbstick Up: Move Ship Forward 

Thumbstick Down: Move Ship Backwards 

Thumbstick Left: Rotate Ship Left

Thumbstick Right: Rotate Ship Right

Point index finger to activate/deactivate objects on mini map

### Dashboard Capabilities: 
**Left Side Dashboard- 3D Mini Map:**

Map shows the current positions of the planets and spaceship in the solar system.

Highlight a planet using your index finger to point and touch the planet on the planet tracker/mini map. Touch the planet again to deactivate the planet tracker. Highlighting a planet on the planet tracker causes a position marker to appear above the actual planet outside the ship, along with planet name, current distance from planet, and estimate time of arrival to planet at current speed.  Multiple trackers can be activated at a time. 

**Center of Dashboard- Planet Proximity and Information:**

Display warns if a planet is in close proximity and the information related to the respective planet. The type of information displayed is the planet's average distance from the sun, radius, number of moons and/or rings, as well as type of planet (i.e. Terrestrial, Gas Giant, Ice Giant)

**Right of Dashboard-Speed:**

Display shows current speed and in reference to the speed of light. 

### Back Monitors
Behind the player is a set of computer monitors that display the instructions of the game for the player to reference during the game.

The only <a href="https://thomaskole.wordpress.com/portfolio/how-to-generate-a-physically-accurate-star-field-in-unity-using-real-world-data/">guide</a> is outdated so Viet is trying to recreate that with the newer version of Unity.
